# NLP-Chatbot

Develop a local chatbot that uses a small language model (LLM) without relying on external APIs. The chatbot should be capable of engaging in daily conversations with users, functioning like a virtual assistant. It needs to be trained using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perfect its conversational abilities.
The success of the chatbot will be measured based on its ability to:
1.	Place a phone call to a hair salon and successfully book an appointment.
2.	Place a phone call to a restaurant and order food according to the user's specifications.
3.	Place a phone call to a friend, emulate my voice, and carry out an entire conversation without my friend realizing they're talking to an AI instead of me.
4.	Build a conversational AI that can interact seamlessly with humans in real-time and perform specific tasks through phone calls.
5.	This will likely involve training the chatbot on a large dataset of conversations, developing robust speech recognition and synthesis capabilities, and ensuring the AI can handle various conversational nuances.

Step 1: Set Up Environment

1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: keep dependencies isolated.

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # env\Scripts\activate
   ```

Step 2: Install Required Libraries

1. **Install Essential Libraries**: Use pip

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Step 3: Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. **Collect Data**: Download conversational datasets like the **Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus** or **Persona-Chat**.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and preprocess the data.

   ```python
   import nltk
   from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews

   nltk.download('movie_reviews')
   # Data preprocessing steps like tokenization, removing special characters, etc.
   ```

Step 4: Model Training

1. **Choose a Model Architecture**: Use pre built model like GPT-2 or BERT to train.

   ```python
   from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
   tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
   model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
   ```

2. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Train the model on my dataset.

   ```python
   from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments   
   training_args = TrainingArguments(
       output_dir='./results',
       num_train_epochs=3,
       per_device_train_batch_size=4,
       save_steps=10_000,
       save_total_limit=2,
   )
   trainer = Trainer(
       model=model,
       args=training_args,
       train_dataset=train_dataset,
       eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
   )   
   trainer.train()
   ```

Step 5: Specific Task Training

1. **Train for Specific Tasks**: Create separate training loops for each task like appointments, ordering food, etc.

   ```python
   # Custom dataset and training loop for hair salon appointment task
   ```

Step 6: Voice Emulation

1. **Voice Synthesis**: Use libraries like Tacotron 2 or WaveNet.

   ```python
   # Example code for voice synthesis
   from pydub import AudioSegment
   from pydub.playback import play
   
   sound = AudioSegment.from_file("path_to_audio.wav")
   play(sound)
   ```

Step 7: Evaluation and Testing

1. **Test Bot**: Ensure it can handle the specific tasks efficiently.

2. **Refine and Iterate**: Based on feedback, fine-tune the model.

Step 8: Documentation and Tutorials

1. Follow detailed tutorials and document progress.
